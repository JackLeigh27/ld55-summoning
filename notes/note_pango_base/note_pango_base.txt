This is a base package which projects should be built from.

It provides a basic setup which should be extended:

* 0.Core:
	This has the basic fundamentals that power the game:
		- Game initialization
		- Entity management
		- Input handling
		- Display management
		- Graphics scaling
	Do NOT edit this folder unless something should be added to the base package.
	Any modifications specific to your game should be done in the extension folder or additional folders.
		
* 0.Core-Extension:
	This folder allows you to:
		- Configure game initializationn
		- Configure new inputs
		- Set default scaling values
		- Bind new entity types
		
Anything that does not apply to the above should be in its own folder.
